AUTOMATIC IRIS CLASSIFICATION FINAL PROJECT

Project Status:

I managed to complete the assignment. My project follows all of the guidelines set forth by the project pdf. I attempted to 
follow the example set forth in the project pdf as closely as possible. As this was not really a creative project, and rather a 
statistical / small-scale machine learning project, no creative liberties were taken. In terms of the actual code, I have attempted 
to make it neat and orderly by breaking it up into sections of code and using comments. Some comments are additionally tests I did 
along the way to make sure my project was working properly.

There are no additional features included in this project as I was mainly focused on learning and understanding the machine 
learning and statistical components to the fullest. These included learning more about normalization, standard deviation, and 
training a computer using data to be able to identify different types of iris flowers.

I am satisfied with the outcome of the project. I have enjoyed learning about the very basics of machine learning. With 
my limited coding and statistical knowledge, I see this project working correctly as an accomplishment.

My Retrospective:

The parts of the project that were particularly challenging were the some of the statistics and also really understanding
what we are trying to accomplish with this code. That is very confusing for someone with limited machine learning knowledge. 
In addition to these complexities, using turtle to draw the graph was quite challenging. It was tough to understand how to 
spread the data out over the graph and properly visualize it.

Some of the calculations -- the actual math -- wase actually easier than expected. This included the distance formula and the 
mean and standard deviation formulas. The loops were the challenging part,especially in the normalize_data and make_predictions 
functions. I am proud of my code for these functions.

I think if I could I would have approached the problem from a more statistical or real life approach if I could do it again,
just to get a better gist of the importance of this and its application to the real world.

Additional thoughts:

The instructions were clear at times and more unclear at other times. It did a good job explaining the step by step processes 
that we were supposed to take to properly create the project, however, not such a good job explaining the statistics and the 
reasoning behind what we are doing. In addition, for the normalize function it was unclear that we were supposed to change the 
actual values in the data to the normalized values.

I liked the support I recieved. I also used the PTC as a big resource for this project. I think this project has given me some 
cool insights into data science and what it really takes to analyze data and create a mini-machine learning program. I thought 
this was really interesting and insightful and makes me want to learn more about machine learning and data science. I found it 
quite useful and more applicable to real life than our other homework assignments.
